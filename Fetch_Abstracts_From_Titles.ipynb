Microbial public goods systems employ diverse solutions to this dilemma, yet most studies assume fixed strategies wherein genotypes function strictly as cooperators or cheaters. Here, using the GAL/MEL regulon ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, we uncover a dynamic resolution to this conflict through facultative strategy switching. When haploid cheater-cooperator strains were co-evolved in melibiose, we observed the repeated emergence of same-mating-type diploid hybrids. These hybrids arise early in evolution and ultimately spread in the population. The hybrids exploit the public good produced by cooperator strains when present, acting as facultative cheaters. However, following cooperator extinction, hybrids switch to a cooperative phenotype. This dynamic role transition enables the hybrid to persist across shifting ecological contexts. Our findings reveal a novel, context-dependent mechanism of cooperation maintenance, whereby facultative cheating and genotype plasticity resolve the tension between individual fitness and collective benefit. This work expands the conceptual framework of social evolution by demonstrating that phenotypic flexibility, facilitated through hybridization, can stabilize cooperation even in fully exploitable public goods systems.\",Crossref\n",

However, how does the likelihood of these possibilities change with minute changes in the environment? In this study, we evolveSaccharomyces cerevisiaein environments which only differed in how sugar source is presented to the population. In one set of populations, carbon was presented as a mixture of glucose-galactose, and in the other, as melibiose, a glucose-galactose disaccharide. Since the two environments only differ in how the two monosaccharides are packaged, we call these environments „synonymous‟. Our results show that subtle changes in environments change the targets of selection between the two sets of evolved populations. However, despite different adaptive responses, pleiotropic effects of adaptation are largely predictable. Genome sequencing results demonstrate that small changes in the environment also strongly dictates the genetic basis of adaptation.\",Crossref\n",

A striking pattern, global epistasis, results in fitness effects varying systematically with background fitness—often making beneficial mutations less effective in fitter genotypes. Despite its ubiquity and importance in predicting evolution, the cellular origin of this pattern is unclear. We present a microbial cell growth model and show that global epistasis arises naturally from the underlying metabolic structure, and is modulated by reaction speeds and flux redistribution in the cell. Mutations in standalone rate-limiting modules yield predictable fitness effects, while those in interconnected modules behave idiosyncratically. As genetic divergence increases, background fitness becomes a poorer predictor of fitness effects. Our framework links cellular metabolism to adaptation, offering mechanistic insights into evolutionary predictability.\",Crossref\n",

            "How epistasis hinders or facilitates movement on fitness landscapes has been a longstanding question of interest. Several high throughput experiments have demonstrated that despite its idiosyncrasy, epistatic effects exhibit global statistical patterns. Recently, Papkou et. al. constructed a fitness landscape for a 9-base region in the folA gene, which encodes for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in E. coli, and demonstrated that despite being highly rugged, the landscape is highly navigable. In this work, using the folA landscape, we ask two questions: (1) How does the nature of epistatic interactions change as a function of the genomic background? (2) How predictable is epistasis within a gene? Our results show that epistasis is “fluid” - the nature of epistasis exhibited by a pair of mutations is strongly contingent on the genetic background. Mutations exhibit one of two binary “states”: a small fraction of mutations exhibit extremely strong patterns of global epistasis, while most do not. Despite these observations, we observe that the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of a genotype is highly predictable based on its fitness. These results offer a new perspective on how epistasis operates within a gene, and how it can be predicted.\",Crossref\n",

            "               In evolutionary game theory, a relative comparison of the cost and benefit associated with obtaining a resource, called payoff, is used as an indicator of fitness of an organism. Payoffs of different strategies, quantitatively represented as payoff matrices, are used to understand complex inter-species and intra-species interactions like cooperation, mutualism, and altruism. Payoff matrices, however, are usually treated as invariant with time—largely due to the absence of any empirical data quantifying their evolution. In this paper, we present empirical evidence of three types of resource-dependent changes in the payoff matrices of evolving Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We show that depending on the carbon source and participating genotypes, N-player games could collapse, be born, or be maintained. Our results highlight the need to consider the dynamic nature of payoff matrices while making even short-term predictions about population interactions and dynamics.\",Crossref\n",

While this process speeds up adaptation, the functionality of horizontally transferred genes is highly constrained in the new hosts due to several reasons, and protein localization is one of them. In this study, we ask what is the minimum number of mutations that can resolve a localization problem faced by a horizontally transferred protein in a new host. Using a directed-evolution approach, we show that SNPs and a synonymous mutation can change the localization patterns of an ammonia transporter (AmtA) moved fromDictyostelium discoideumtoSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly, the mutations that cause this change in localization, confer different fitness effects, are spread throughout the gene, and do not cause a uniform change in amino acids. In a novel attempt, we show how SNPs or a synonymous mutation can alter the membrane affinity of proteins, and as a result, aiding protein evolution and functional diversification.\",Crossref\n"

            "AbstractThe persistence of cooperation in the face of cheating is a central paradox in evolutionary biology. Microbial public goods systems employ diverse solutions to this dilemma, yet most studies assume fixed strategies wherein genotypes function strictly as cooperators or cheaters. Here, using the GAL/MEL regulon ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, we uncover a dynamic resolution to this conflict through facultative strategy switching. When haploid cheater-cooperator strains were co-evolved in melibiose, we observed the repeated emergence of same-mating-type diploid hybrids. These hybrids arise early in evolution and ultimately spread in the population. The hybrids exploit the public good produced by cooperator strains when present, acting as facultative cheaters. However, following cooperator extinction, hybrids switch to a cooperative phenotype. This dynamic role transition enables the hybrid to persist across shifting ecological contexts. Our findings reveal a novel, context-dependent mechanism of cooperation maintenance, whereby facultative cheating and genotype plasticity resolve the tension between individual fitness and collective benefit. This work expands the conceptual framework of social evolution by demonstrating that phenotypic flexibility, facilitated through hybridization, can stabilize cooperation even in fully exploitable public goods systems.\n",
